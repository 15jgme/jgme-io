				After recently finishing my Master's, I'm currently living in Montreal and working as a
				software developer contracted to CAE, my main work is on the dynamics models of the
				company's flight simulators.

			<p>
				In my free time (and outside of side-projects) I love to cook, bike, and fall a lot as a
				bouldering novice ðŸ§—
